# CryptoApp-MVVM


 This application has been developed using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern and RxSwift. Serving as a platform that lists cryptocurrency names and prices, the MVVM design pattern organizes the codebase, making it more orderly and manageable, thereby facilitating maintenance and the addition of future updates. The use of RxSwift provides advantages in asynchronous programming and event-driven programming. Users can track real-time cryptocurrency information through the application. Additionally, the application's performance is enhanced, and the development process is optimized, thanks to the implementation of this design pattern and the use of RxSwift.

# MVVM Design Pattern
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is an architectural design pattern in software development, dividing applications into three key components:
Model: Manages data and business logic, handling data retrieval and storage.

View: Represents the user interface, responsible for displaying data and updating based on changes observed in the ViewModel.
ViewModel: Serves as an intermediary, processing data from the Model for presentation in the View. It contains application logic, handling user inputs and interactions.
MVVM encourages separation of concerns, enhancing code modularity and simplifying maintenance. It also supports effective unit testing by allowing each component to be tested independently.
