# CryptoApp-MVVM


 This application has been developed using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern and RxSwift. Serving as a platform that lists cryptocurrency names and prices, the MVVM design pattern organizes the codebase, making it more orderly and manageable, thereby facilitating maintenance and the addition of future updates. The use of RxSwift provides advantages in asynchronous programming and event-driven programming. Users can track real-time cryptocurrency information through the application. Additionally, the application's performance is enhanced, and the development process is optimized, thanks to the implementation of this design pattern and the use of RxSwift.
